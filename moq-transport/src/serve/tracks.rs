//! A broadcast is a collection of tracks, split into two handles: [Writer] and [Reader].
//!
//! The [Writer] can create tracks, either manually or on request.
//! It receives all requests by a [Reader] for a tracks that don't exist.
//! The simplest implementation is to close every unknown track with [ServeError::NotFound].
//!
//! A [Reader] can request tracks by name.
//! If the track already exists, it will be returned.
//! If the track doesn't exist, it will be sent to [Unknown] to be handled.
//! A [Reader] can be cloned to create multiple subscriptions.
//!
//! The broadcast is automatically closed with [ServeError::Done] when [Writer] is dropped, or all [Reader]s are dropped.
